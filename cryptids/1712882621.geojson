    "description": "Steller's sea ape is a purported marine mammal observed by German zoologist Georg Steller on August 10, 1741, around the Shumagin Islands, Alaska. It was described as being 5 ft (1.5 m) long, with a dog-like head; long, drooping whiskers; an elongated but fat body; a thick fur coat; no limbs; and two tail fins much like a shark. He described the creature as being playful and inquisitive, much like a monkey. After observing it for two hours, he attempted to shoot and collect the creature, but missed, and the creature swam away. A similar creature was seen in June, 1965, by sailor Miles Smeeton and company off Atka Island, Alaska.",
