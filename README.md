[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/simonw/cryptozoology.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/simonw/cryptozoology)

Crowdsourcing a directory of cryptids and their range maps.

## Contributing

Please help build this directory! You can contribute by editing existing
listings or creating new ones, then submitting a pull request.

Each individual cryptid is represented by a GeoJSON file.

To create a new cryptid, first reserve a unique integer for the filename using
https://www.brooklynintegers.com/create/

Then create a GeoJSON file based on a previous example. We suggest editing it
using the free online tool http://geojson.io/

Once you are done, submit a pull request to this repository!
